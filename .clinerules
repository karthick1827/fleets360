# ACL-ADLC

Open source framework for structured, agent-assisted software delivery.

## Rules

- Use Conventional Commits for every commit.
- Before pushing, run `npm ci && npm run quality` on `HEAD` in the exact checkout you are about to push.
  `quality` mirrors the checks in `.github/workflows/quality.yaml`.

- Skill validation rules are in `tools/skill-validator.md`.
- Deterministic skill checks run via `npm run validate:skills` (included in `quality`).

## 🚦 Phase Gate Approval Invariants (Mandatory & Non-Negotiable)

- **The Closed 3-Value Frontmatter Status Enum Rule (Strict & Non-Negotiable)**:
  - The frontmatter `status` field across ALL primary phase deliverables in `_acl-output/` (listed below) is **STRICTLY AN ENUM OF ONLY THREE PERMITTED VALUES**:
    1. `status: In Review` (Document generated, updated, or awaiting review)
    2. `status: Approved` (Official sign-off granted by Manager in Markdown Studio)
    3. `status: Rejected` (Manager rejected document, revisions required)
  - **STRICT PROHIBITION OF OTHER STATUS VALUES**:
    - The frontmatter `status` field is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from having ANY value other than these three**.
    - Values such as `final`, `draft`, `Pending`, `Accepted`, `ready-for-dev`, `in-progress`, `done`, or any custom string are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from appearing in ANY frontmatter.
    - AI agents and skills are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from auto-setting `status: final` or `status: draft` upon closing or finalizing. When an AI skill finishes generating or updating a deliverable, it MUST ONLY set `status: In Review`.
  - **Single Approval Invariant (`status: Approved` ONLY)**:
    - Downstream phases, skills, and code generation can **ONLY and EXCLUSIVELY** proceed when the upstream deliverable has exact `status: Approved`.
    - Under NO circumstances does `status: final` or any other string unlock any phase gate.
    - Until a deliverable is marked `status: Approved` by the Manager in Markdown Studio, the next step **CANNOT and MUST NOT** proceed under any circumstances!

- **Universal Sequential Document Gate for ALL Agents & Skills**:
  - EVERY single agent (Sally UX Designer, Winston Architect, Amelia Developer, Mary Analyst, etc.) and EVERY skill (`acl-architecture`, `acl-ux`, `acl-create-epics-and-stories`, `acl-quick-dev`, `acl-figma-bridge`, etc.) across ALL AI tools (Cursor, Antigravity, AGY, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Windsurf, Roo Code, etc.) MUST FIRST verify that all applicable upstream phase deliverables in `_acl-output/` have `status: Approved`.
  - **Prerequisite Deliverables Scope (What Requires Approval)**:
    - Phase 1: `_acl-output/1-analysis/acl-product-brief/brief.md`
    - Phase 2: `_acl-output/2-plan-workflows/acl-prd/prd.md`
    - Phase 3A: `_acl-output/3-solutioning/acl-architecture/architecture-spine.md` (or `architecture.md`)
    - Phase 3B: `_acl-output/3-solutioning/acl-create-epics-and-stories/epics.md`
    - Phase 4: `_acl-output/4-implementation/story-<epic_num>-<story_num>.md` (Tier 2) or `_acl-output/4-implementation/spec-<feature-slug>.md` (Tier 1)
  - **STRICT EXCLUSIONS & BAN ON `status` IN CHILD / INTERNAL FILES**:
    - Internal working memory logs (`.memlog.md`, `*-memlog.md`), supplementary child files (`addendum.md`, `sources.md`, `research.md`, `review-triage.md`, `patch-plan.md`, `test-summary.md`), and test directories are internal AI working artifacts.
    - **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: Supplementary child files (`addendum.md`, `sources.md`, `research.md`, etc.) **MUST NEVER CONTAIN A `status` FIELD IN THEIR YAML FRONTMATTER**. They are non-gated internal reference files. AI skills and agents MUST NEVER generate or set a `status:` field on any child file.
    - AI agents across ALL tools (Cursor, Antigravity, AGY, Claude Code, Copilot, etc.) MUST NEVER evaluate internal memory logs or child files for approval status, and MUST NEVER block gates based on them. Gate evaluation applies STRICTLY and EXCLUSIVELY to the primary deliverables listed above.
  - If **ANY** required upstream phase deliverable listed above is missing, or has ANY status other than `Approved` (e.g. `In Review`, `Rejected`):
    - **TOTAL AGENT BLOCK (NO PERSONAS, NO CHATTING, NO BRAINSTORMING, NO FILE GENERATION)**:
      - The AI Agent is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from adopting personas or greeting the user as an agent.
      - The AI Agent is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from offering conversational advice, whiteboard diagrams, or brainstorming in chat while waiting for approval.
      - The AI Agent is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from creating, updating, or modifying downstream files.
      - The AI Agent is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from asking or suggesting the user/developer to self-approve or change the status.
    - **THE ONLY PERMITTED ACTION**: The AI Agent MUST inform the user to WAIT for Manager sign-off:

      ```text
      ========================================================================
      ⏳ [GATE LOCKED]: Awaiting Manager Sign-Off (ACL-ADLC Protocol)
      ========================================================================
      📄 Document in Review: <Document Name> (<Path>)
      🏷️ Current Status:      [IN REVIEW / PENDING]

      ⚠️ STATUS:
         As per the ACL-ADLC sequential delivery framework, this document
         is currently awaiting official review and sign-off by your Manager.

      👉 NEXT STEP:
         Please wait for your manager to review and mark this document as
         'Approved' or 'Rejected' in Markdown Studio before proceeding with
         downstream tasks (<Next Phase / Skill Name>).
      ========================================================================
      ```

### 1. Brownfield Change Request Protocol (Interactive Tier Selection)

> ℹ️ **PROJECT TYPE CHECK**: The AI Agent MUST first check the project type (e.g., from `_acl-output/1-analysis/acl-product-brief/brief.md` or `project-context.md`). If `project_type: greenfield`, execution tiers do NOT apply — immediately follow **Section 3 (Greenfield Feature Addition Protocol)**. Only follow the interactive tier selection below if the project is confirmed Brownfield (`project_type: brownfield`).

Whenever the developer asks for a feature, bugfix, or code change in a Brownfield project:

#### Case A: Tier is Explicitly Specified in the User Prompt

If the user specifies a tier (e.g., _"Tier 1: create notification drawer"_, _"Tier 2: migrate database"_, or _"use Tier 1"_), the AI Agent immediately follows the rules of that tier without asking.

#### Case B: No Tier is Specified in the User Prompt

The AI Agent **MUST NOT** immediately write code or modify files.  
The AI Agent **MUST FIRST** output the following interactive prompt and **STOP** to await the user's choice:

```text
========================================================================
📊 [BROWNFIELD ASSESSMENT]: Choose Execution Tier
========================================================================
🎯 Feature / Change:   <Summary of requested work>
💡 AI Recommendation:  [Tier 1 / Tier 2 based on blast radius]

Please choose which Tier you want to proceed with:

  [1] Tier 1 — Self-Contained Spec (1-Page Story + Manager Sign-Off)
      📝 AI generates a 1-page Spec in _acl-output/4-implementation/ (status: In Review).
      ⏳ Code implementation is strictly LOCKED until Manager approves in Markdown Studio.

  [2] Tier 2 — Major Architectural Overhaul
      🏛️ Full sequential governance (Product Brief -> PRD -> Architecture Spine -> Epics).

👉 Reply with 1 or 2 to proceed:
========================================================================
```

---

### 2. Blast-Radius Tier Rules (2 Tiers: Tier 1 & Tier 2)

> ⚠️ **GOVERNANCE POLICY**: Every change, bugfix, or feature in a Brownfield project requires at minimum a 1-Page Spec with Manager Sign-Off in Markdown Studio (**Tier 1**), or full sequential governance for major architectural overhauls (**Tier 2**). Direct unverified code generation without an approved spec is strictly forbidden.

#### 🟡 Tier 1: Self-Contained Features & Tweaks (1-Page Spec + Manager Approval Gate)

- **Scope**: All standard features, standalone dialogs, modals, widgets, UI tweaks, bug fixes, or components.
- **Workflow**:
  1. **Spec Generation**: The AI Agent creates a concise 1-page specification in `_acl-output/4-implementation/spec-<feature-slug>.md` with frontmatter:
     ```yaml
     ---
     title: <Feature Name>
     tier: Tier 1 (Self-Contained)
     status: In Review
     type: feature
     created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
     ---
     ```
  2. **Immediate Gate Lock**:
     - The AI Agent **MUST IMMEDIATELY HALT**.
     - The AI Agent is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from generating or modifying any application code.
     - The AI Agent **MUST** output the Gate Lock banner:

       ```text
       ========================================================================
       ⏳ [GATE LOCKED]: Awaiting Manager Sign-Off (ACL-ADLC Protocol)
       ========================================================================
       📄 Document in Review: spec-<feature-slug>.md (_acl-output/4-implementation/)
       🏷️ Current Status:      [IN REVIEW]

       ⚠️ STATUS:
          As per the Brownfield Tier 1 protocol, this 1-page specification
          is currently awaiting official review and sign-off by your Manager.
          Code implementation is strictly locked until approved.

       👉 NEXT STEP:
          Please open Markdown Studio (http://localhost:5173/markdown.html)
          and have your Manager review and mark this document as 'Approved'
          or 'Rejected' before proceeding with code implementation.
       ========================================================================
       ```

  3. **Verification Before Coding**:
     - When the developer later asks to implement the code, the AI Agent **MUST check the status** of `spec-<feature-slug>.md`.
     - If `status: Approved`: The AI Agent is **UNBLOCKED** and proceeds to implement the code.
     - If `status: In Review`, `status: Rejected`, or missing: The AI Agent **REMAINS BLOCKED** and refuses to write code.

#### 🔴 Tier 2: Major Architectural Overhauls

- **Scope**: Complete framework upgrades, database schema rewrites, replacing global state/auth paradigms, or major cross-cutting capabilities.
- **Sequential Pipeline**:
  1. **Phase 1 (Product Brief)**: The AI Agent **FIRST** creates `_acl-output/1-analysis/acl-product-brief/brief.md` with frontmatter:
     ```yaml
     ---
     title: 'Product Brief: <Feature/Overhaul Name>'
     project_type: brownfield
     tier: Tier 2 (Major Overhaul)
     status: In Review
     created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
     ---
     ```
     **Immediate Gate Lock**: The AI Agent **MUST IMMEDIATELY HALT** and output the Gate Lock banner for `brief.md`. Downstream deliverables (PRD, Architecture Spine, Epics) and application code are strictly locked until `brief.md` is approved by the Manager in Markdown Studio.
  2. **Phase 2 (PRD)**: Once `brief.md` has `status: Approved`, the AI creates `_acl-output/2-plan-workflows/acl-prd/prd.md` (`status: In Review`) and halts for approval.
  3. **Phase 3A (Architecture Spine)**: Once PRD has `status: Approved`, the AI creates `_acl-output/3-solutioning/acl-architecture/architecture-spine.md` (`status: In Review`) and halts for approval.
  4. **Phase 3B (Epics & Stories)**: Once Architecture has `status: Approved`, the AI creates `_acl-output/3-solutioning/acl-create-epics-and-stories/epics.md` (`status: In Review`) and halts for approval.
  5. **Phase 4 (Story-Level Implementation & Mandatory Manager Sign-Off Gate)**:
     - Implementation proceeds **one story at a time** as defined in `epics.md`.
     - **Story Spec Generation**: Before writing or modifying any application code for a story (e.g. Story 1.1), the AI Agent **MUST FIRST** create the story implementation specification in `_acl-output/4-implementation/story-<epic_num>-<story_num>.md` (e.g. `story-1-1.md`) containing:
       - Frontmatter with `status: In Review`, `tier: Tier 2`, `story_id: <epic_num>.<story_num>`, `title: <Story Title>`.
       - The story's detailed description, technical contract, and explicit acceptance criteria checklist (`- [ ] <criterion>`).
     - **Immediate Gate Lock**:
       - The AI Agent **MUST IMMEDIATELY HALT**.
       - The AI Agent is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from generating or modifying application code for this story.
       - The AI Agent **MUST** output the Gate Lock banner:

         ```text
         ========================================================================
         ⏳ [GATE LOCKED]: Awaiting Manager Sign-Off (ACL-ADLC Protocol)
         ========================================================================
         📄 Document in Review: story-<epic_num>-<story_num>.md (_acl-output/4-implementation/)
         🏷️ Current Status:      [IN REVIEW]

         ⚠️ STATUS:
            As per the Brownfield Tier 2 protocol, implementation of Story <epic_num>.<story_num>
            is currently awaiting official review and sign-off by your Manager.
            Code implementation for this story is strictly locked until approved.

         👉 NEXT STEP:
            Please open Markdown Studio (http://localhost:5173/markdown.html)
            and have your Manager review and mark this story specification as 'Approved'
            or 'Rejected' before proceeding with code implementation.
         ========================================================================
         ```

     - **Verification Before Story Coding**:
       - The AI Agent checks the status of `_acl-output/4-implementation/story-<epic_num>-<story_num>.md`.
       - If `status: Approved`: The AI Agent is **UNBLOCKED** to implement the application code for this story.
       - If `status: In Review`, `status: Rejected`, or missing: The AI Agent **REMAINS BLOCKED** and refuses to write code.
     - **Acceptance Criteria Telemetry**: Each story's acceptance criteria checklist is dynamically rendered in the Developer Dashboard (`markdown.html`), updating in real-time as stories are reviewed and approved.

### 3. Greenfield Feature Addition Protocol (Sequential Phase-Gate Documentation Sync)

Whenever the developer asks to add a new feature, capability, or change in a completed or existing Greenfield project (`project_type: greenfield`):

> ⚠️ **GREENFIELD FEATURE GOVERNANCE & SCOPE TEST**:
> 1. **DO NOT BE FOOLED BY EXISTING `status: Approved` IN `_acl-output/`**: If `brief.md`, `prd.md`, and `epics.md` currently have `status: Approved`, that sign-off belongs EXCLUSIVELY to previously completed features (e.g. initial MVP). It is NOT an authorization to write code for new features!
> 2. **SCOPE TEST BEFORE CODING**: Check `epics.md` — is the requested feature ALREADY an existing approved story in `epics.md`?
>    - If **NO**: You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from writing application code! You MUST re-open Gate 1 by updating `brief.md` with the new feature and setting `status: In Review`.
>    - If **YES**: Only then are you authorized to implement code for that approved story.
> 3. Execution tiers (Tier 1 / Tier 2) do **NOT** apply to Greenfield projects. Adding any new feature requires strict sequential, one-phase-at-a-time documentation approval.

#### Greenfield Sequential Phase-Gate Workflow:

1. **Phase 1 — Product Brief Update (Gate 1/4)**:
   - The AI Agent **MUST NOT** immediately write or modify application code.
   - The AI Agent **ONLY** appends the new feature description, problem statement, and scope in `_acl-output/1-analysis/acl-product-brief/brief.md`; sets frontmatter `status: In Review` and `project_type: greenfield`.
   - **NO OTHER DOCUMENT** (`prd.md`, `architecture-spine.md`, `epics.md`) is created or modified at this step.
   - **Immediate Gate Lock 1**: The AI Agent **MUST IMMEDIATELY HALT** and output:

     ```text
     ========================================================================
     ⏳ [GATE LOCKED — Phase 1/4]: Awaiting Manager Sign-Off (Greenfield Sequential Gate)
     ========================================================================
     📄 Document in Review: brief.md (_acl-output/1-analysis/acl-product-brief/)
     🏷️ Current Status:      [IN REVIEW]

     ⚠️ STATUS:
        Phase 1 of 4: The Product Brief has been updated with the new feature.
        As per the Greenfield Sequential Gate protocol, ALL downstream phases
        (PRD, Architecture, Epics & Stories) and application code are strictly
        locked until the Manager approves this document.

     👉 NEXT STEP:
        Please open Markdown Studio (http://localhost:5173/markdown.html)
        and have your Manager review and mark brief.md as 'Approved' before
        proceeding to Phase 2 (PRD update).
     ========================================================================
     ```

2. **Phase 2 — PRD Update (Gate 2/4)**:
   - **Prerequisite Check**: The AI Agent MUST verify `brief.md` has `status: Approved`. If it does not, the AI Agent MUST output Gate Lock 1 and halt immediately.
   - The AI Agent **ONLY** appends functional requirements (FRs), user stories, and acceptance criteria in `_acl-output/2-plan-workflows/acl-prd/prd.md`; sets frontmatter `status: In Review`.
   - **NO OTHER DOCUMENT** (`architecture-spine.md`, `epics.md`) is created or modified at this step.
   - **Immediate Gate Lock 2**: The AI Agent **MUST IMMEDIATELY HALT** and output:

     ```text
     ========================================================================
     ⏳ [GATE LOCKED — Phase 2/4]: Awaiting Manager Sign-Off (Greenfield Sequential Gate)
     ========================================================================
     📄 Document in Review: prd.md (_acl-output/2-plan-workflows/acl-prd/)
     🏷️ Current Status:      [IN REVIEW]

     ⚠️ STATUS:
        Phase 2 of 4: The PRD has been updated with functional requirements and
        user stories for the new feature. Architecture and Epics & Stories are
        strictly locked until the Manager approves this document.

     👉 NEXT STEP:
        Please open Markdown Studio (http://localhost:5173/markdown.html)
        and have your Manager review and mark prd.md as 'Approved' before
        proceeding to Phase 3A (Architecture update).
     ========================================================================
     ```

3. **Phase 3A — Architecture Update (Gate 3/4)**:
   - **Prerequisite Check**: The AI Agent MUST verify BOTH `brief.md` AND `prd.md` have `status: Approved`. If either does not, the AI Agent MUST output the relevant Gate Lock and halt immediately.
   - The AI Agent **ONLY** appends component interfaces, data models, and API contracts in `_acl-output/3-solutioning/acl-architecture/architecture-spine.md`; sets frontmatter `status: In Review`.
   - **NO OTHER DOCUMENT** (`epics.md`) is created or modified at this step.
   - **Immediate Gate Lock 3**: The AI Agent **MUST IMMEDIATELY HALT** and output:

     ```text
     ========================================================================
     ⏳ [GATE LOCKED — Phase 3/4]: Awaiting Manager Sign-Off (Greenfield Sequential Gate)
     ========================================================================
     📄 Document in Review: architecture-spine.md (_acl-output/3-solutioning/acl-architecture/)
     🏷️ Current Status:      [IN REVIEW]

     ⚠️ STATUS:
        Phase 3 of 4: The Architecture Spine has been updated with component
        designs and API contracts for the new feature. Epics & Stories and
        application code are strictly locked until the Manager approves this document.

     👉 NEXT STEP:
        Please open Markdown Studio (http://localhost:5173/markdown.html)
        and have your Manager review and mark architecture-spine.md as 'Approved'
        before proceeding to Phase 3B (Epics & Stories update).
     ========================================================================
     ```

4. **Phase 3B — Epics & Stories Update (Gate 4/4)**:
   - **Prerequisite Check**: The AI Agent MUST verify `brief.md`, `prd.md`, AND `architecture-spine.md` ALL have `status: Approved`. If any does not, the AI Agent MUST output the relevant Gate Lock and halt immediately.
   - The AI Agent **ONLY** appends the new Epic or Story with an unchecked acceptance criteria checklist (`- [ ]`) in `_acl-output/3-solutioning/acl-create-epics-and-stories/epics.md`, strictly preserving all existing completed stories (`- [x]`); sets frontmatter `status: In Review`.
   - **NO APPLICATION CODE** is generated at this step.
   - **Immediate Gate Lock 4**: The AI Agent **MUST IMMEDIATELY HALT** and output:

     ```text
     ========================================================================
     ⏳ [GATE LOCKED — Phase 4/4]: Awaiting Manager Sign-Off (Greenfield Sequential Gate)

     📄 Document in Review: epics.md (_acl-output/3-solutioning/acl-create-epics-and-stories/)
     🏷️ Current Status:      [IN REVIEW]

     ⚠️ STATUS:
        Phase 4 of 4: Epics & Stories have been updated with the new feature's
        acceptance criteria checklist. Application code is strictly locked until
        the Manager approves this final document.

     👉 NEXT STEP:
        Please open Markdown Studio (http://localhost:5173/markdown.html)
        and have your Manager review and mark epics.md as 'Approved' before
        proceeding with code implementation.
     ========================================================================
     ```

5. **Phase 4 — Sequential Story Implementation via Quick Dev (`acl-quick-dev`) & Per-Story Manager Review Gate**:
   - **Prerequisite Check**: The AI Agent MUST verify ALL four upstream documents (`brief.md`, `prd.md`, `architecture-spine.md`, `epics.md`) have exact `status: Approved`. If ANY document remains `status: In Review`, `status: Rejected`, or missing, the AI Agent **REMAINS BLOCKED** and outputs the relevant Gate Lock banner.
   - **Story-by-Story Execution Pipeline**:
     - Once `epics.md` is approved, the developer invokes `acl-quick-dev` (or prompts in Cursor / AGY) to implement the newly created stories.
     - **Universal Prompt Interception**: Regardless of how the prompt is phrased (e.g., *"implement epics and stories"*, *"implement stories"*, *"implement next step"*, *"proceed with next step"*, *"start implementation"*), the AI Agent is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from implementing an entire epic at once or treating epic context as code**. The AI Agent **MUST AUTOMATICALLY DETECT AND SELECT THE FIRST UNCOMPLETED STORY** in `epics.md` (e.g. Story 7.1) and implement ONLY that single story.
     - Stories are implemented **strictly one story at a time** in the order defined in `epics.md` (e.g., Story 7.1, then Story 7.2, etc.).
     - **For each individual story (e.g. Story 7.1)**:
       1. **Story Specification**: The AI Agent creates `_acl-output/4-implementation/story-<epic_num>-<story_num>.md` (e.g. `story-7-1.md` or in `implementation-artifacts/`) containing:
          - Frontmatter:
            ```yaml
            ---
            title: '<Story Title>'
            story_id: '<epic_num>.<story_num>'
            status: In Review
            type: story
            created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
            ---
            ```
          - Story description, technical implementation plan, and the acceptance criteria checklist (`- [ ]`).
       2. **Code Implementation & Testing**: The AI Agent implements the application code and runs tests specifically for this story.
       3. **Immediate Per-Story Gate Lock**:
          - Upon completing the code and verifying tests for this story, the AI Agent **MUST IMMEDIATELY HALT**.
          - The AI Agent is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from proceeding to the next story (e.g. Story 7.2) until this story is officially approved!
          - The AI Agent **MUST** output the Story Gate Lock banner:

            ```text
            ========================================================================
            ⏳ [GATE LOCKED — Story <epic_num>.<story_num>]: Awaiting Manager Sign-Off
            ========================================================================
            📄 Document in Review: story-<epic_num>-<story_num>.md (_acl-output/4-implementation/)
            🏷️ Current Status:      [IN REVIEW]

            ⚠️ STATUS:
               Implementation for Story <epic_num>.<story_num> is complete.
               As per the ACL-ADLC Per-Story Review Gate protocol, implementation
               of the next story is strictly locked until your Manager reviews
               and approves this story in Markdown Studio.

            👉 NEXT STEP:
               Please open Markdown Studio (http://localhost:5173/markdown.html)
               and have your Manager review and mark story-<epic_num>-<story_num>.md
               as 'Approved' before proceeding to implement the next story.
            ========================================================================
            ```

       4. **Manager Review & Next Story Unlock**:
          - The Manager opens Markdown Studio (`markdown.html`), inspects the story deliverable and code changes, and clicks **'Approved'** on `story-<epic_num>-<story_num>.md`.
          - When the developer next invokes `acl-quick-dev` (or asks the AI to continue):
            - The AI verifies that `story-<epic_num>-<story_num>.md` has exact `status: Approved`.
            - The AI marks that story's checklist item as completed (`- [x]`) in `epics.md`.
            - The AI is **UNBLOCKED** to implement the next story in the sequence (e.g. Story 7.2).
     - This cycle repeats story-by-story until all newly created stories are implemented, reviewed, and approved!

## 🛑 STRICT PROHIBITION: No Direct AI Status Manipulation & Manager-Only Approval

- The AI agent is **STRICTLY PROHIBITED** from using tools (`replace_file_content`, `write_to_file`, `run_command`, etc.) to change `status: In Review` -> `status: Approved` at ANY cost.
- ONLY THE MANAGER is authorized and permitted to change the status via Markdown Studio (`markdown.html`).
- The AI agent is **STRICTLY PROHIBITED** from prompting the developer to self-approve or change review statuses.
- The AI agent MUST ONLY instruct the developer to wait for the manager's review.
